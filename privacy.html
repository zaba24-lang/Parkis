  <h1>Privacy Policy — Parkis</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2026-02-13</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Parkis helps users interpret parking signs. To provide results, the app processes images you choose to capture or select.
    We aim to collect the minimum data needed to operate the app securely and prevent abuse (e.g., credit fraud).
  </p>

  <h2>Data We Collect / Process</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Photos or Videos (User Content)</strong>:
      When you capture or select an image to analyze, the image is processed to generate interpretation results.
      <br/>
      <em>Processing:</em> Images may be transmitted to our backend service for analysis. We do not use your images for advertising.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Device ID / Identifiers</strong>:
      The app and third-party SDKs may process device identifiers to:
      (a) operate core features (credits, subscriptions),
      (b) protect the service (fraud prevention & security),
      and (c) display ads if ads are enabled.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Advertising Data</strong>:
      If ads are enabled, advertising partners may process ad-related signals to show and measure ads (for example: ad impressions,
      clicks, or basic ad performance).
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Product Interaction</strong>:
      We may process interactions inside the app (for example: which screens are opened, paywall views, or ad interactions)
      to operate the app, measure performance, and improve stability.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Diagnostics / Crash Data</strong>:
      Crash logs and basic diagnostic information may be collected to improve stability and fix bugs.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Purchases / Subscriptions</strong>:
      If you purchase credits or a subscription, transaction handling is performed by Apple and our subscription provider (RevenueCat).
      We do not receive or store your full payment card details.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tracking (App Tracking Transparency)</h2>
  <p>
    Parkis does not track you across other companies’ apps and websites for advertising unless you explicitly opt in where required.
    If we ever enable features that require tracking permission, iOS will ask for your consent via App Tracking Transparency (ATT).
  </p>

  <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>App Functionality:</strong> Provide image analysis and results, manage credits/subscriptions, and deliver core features.</li>
    <li><strong>Security & Fraud Prevention:</strong> Detect and prevent abuse (e.g., repeated free credits via reinstall, automated misuse, or tampering).</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics & Performance:</strong> Understand crashes and improve reliability.</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising (if enabled):</strong> Display and measure ads.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell personal data. We share data only with service providers needed to operate the app:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Backend processing/hosting:</strong> used to analyze images and return results.</li>
    <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> subscription and in-app purchase management.</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising partners (e.g., Google AdMob) if ads are enabled:</strong> ad delivery and measurement.</li>
    <li><strong>Crash/diagnostics providers (if enabled):</strong> stability and bug fixing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Images:</strong> Used to generate results. We do not keep your images longer than necessary for processing unless you explicitly enable a saving/history feature (if available in your version of the app).</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> Retained for a limited time to investigate crashes and improve stability.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can deny camera/photo permissions and still use other parts of the app.</li>
    <li>You can disable ads by upgrading if a premium option is available.</li>
    <li>If ATT permission is requested, you can deny it in iOS settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable safeguards to protect data in transit and reduce abuse. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
    If you suspect misuse, contact us immediately.
